David (Firestone, managing editor): Suddenly we're seeing wildfires on the interstate to Cleveland. Some anti-Trump delegates are hoping to use the convention rules to #dumpTrump, and they're even hiring lawyers and advisers. Is this a real thing, or yet another Bill Kristolline fantasy?
Harry (Enten, senior political writer): I think Clare can speak to the seriousness more than I can, but I can say that this isn't just Kristol spouting off. Yes, he has his fantasies, but there's more than just a handful of delegates who are talking about this stuff. Probably not close to a majority, but more than a handful.
Clare (Malone, senior political writer): I was at the beach on Friday when all this broke and not checking the internet. This story surprised me when I finally came back to civilization, let's say that.
